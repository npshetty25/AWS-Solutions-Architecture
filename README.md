AWS Solutions Architecture Job Simulation ‚Äì Forage
This repository contains my completed work for the AWS Solutions Architecture Virtual Job Simulation offered by Forage in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The simulation is designed to mimic the responsibilities of a Solutions Architect, focusing on designing a cloud-based architecture that is scalable, resilient, and cost-effective.

# üîç Project Overview
In this simulation, I assumed the role of an AWS Solutions Architect responding to a client request from a fast-growing startup experiencing issues with application performance, downtime during deployments, and lack of redundancy. The client‚Äôs existing infrastructure relied on a single EC2 instance running a React SPA with a Python Flask backend and PostgreSQL database.

# üß© Tasks and Responsibilities
## The key tasks included:

Analyzing the client's technical and business requirements

Evaluating AWS services suitable for solving performance and reliability challenges

Designing a cloud-native architecture using services like:

Elastic Beanstalk for deployment and autoscaling

Amazon RDS for managed PostgreSQL databases

Amazon S3 for storing static assets

Route 53 for domain management and DNS routing

Elastic Load Balancing for traffic distribution and fault tolerance

AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD automation

Incorporating high availability and disaster recovery using multi-AZ deployments

Drafting a professional client email including a proposed architecture diagram, service justifications, and cost model overview

# üß† Key Learnings
How to match AWS services to business needs

Practical understanding of scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure design

Communication of technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders

Trade-offs between cost, complexity, and performance in cloud architecture
#
# This project demonstrates real-world problem-solving in cloud architecture and is an excellent stepping stone for those aspiring to work in cloud infrastructure or DevOps roles.
